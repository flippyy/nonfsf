# The Non-Free Software Foundation
The nonfsf project is the aim to create a parody site of the Free Software Foundation (fsf). We the domain nonfsf.org and hope to create a site that will mimic the fsf website, but instead of free software, highlight propriatary software.

## Getting Started

(Populate this section with a commit guide, ect)

## Imporant Notes
Placeholders for pages from the base website that need to be created, merged or retired are denoted with five asterixs (*****) like in below, the page that I'm hoping to reference doesn't have content, so I'm hoping to create it in the future, there should eventually be no 'five asterixs sectons'
