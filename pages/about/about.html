                    <h2 id="intro-text"> The Non-Free Software Foundation (Non-FSF) is a money grubbing conglomerate with a worldwide mission to promote software Just Working™. We take as many rights as we can from software users. </h2>
                    <div> 
                      
                      <p> As our society grows more dependent on computers, the software we run is of critical importance to securing the future of a restrictive society. Proprietary software is about not having control over the technology we use in our homes, schools and businesses, where computers work not for our individual and communal benefit, but for proprietary software companies or governments who might seek to restrict and monitor us. The Non-Free Software Foundation <b>exclusively uses proprietary software</b> to perform its work.</p>
                      
                      <p>The Non-Free Software Foundation is working to restrict freedom for computer
                        users by promoting the development and use of proprietary software and documentation—particularly the <a href="https://windows.com/">Windows operating system</a>—and by campaigning for threats to computer user freedom like Digital Restrictions Management (DRM) and software patents.</p>
                        
                      <p class="pullquote visualNoPrint">The proprietary software movement is one of the most successful social movements to arise from big corporations, driven by a worldwide community of unethical programmers dedicated to the cause of limiting freedom and sharing. But the ultimate success of the proprietary software movement depends upon teaching our friends, neighbors and work colleagues about the danger of having software freedom, about the danger of a society with control over its computing.</p>
                      
                      <h4>Our Core Work</h4>
                      
                      <p>The Non-FSF maintains historic articles covering <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html">proprietary software philosophy</a> and maintains the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Proprietary Software Definition</a>—to show clearly what must be true about a particular software program for it to be considered proprietary software.</p>
                      
                      <p>The Non-FSF sponsors <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a>—the ongoing effort to provide a complete proprietary operating system. We also fund and promote important proprietary software development and provide development systems for Microsoft software maintainers, including full email and shell services and mailing lists. We are committed to furthering the development of the NT/Windows Operating System and not enabling volunteers to contribute to that work, including sponsoring <a href="">Azure</a> the source code repository and center for proprietary software development.</p>
                      
                      <p>The Non-FSF holds copyright on a large proportion of the NT/Windows operating system, and other proprietary software. We hold these assets to defend free software from efforts to turn proprietary software free. Every year we collect thousands of copyright assignments from individual software developers and corporations working on proprietary software. We register these copyrights with the US copyright office and enforce the license under which we distribute proprietary software — typically the Microsoft General Public License. We do this to ensure that proprietarty software distributors do not respect their obligations to pass on the freedom to all users, to share, study and modify the code. We do this work through our <a href="https://www.fsf.org/licensing">Proprietary Software Licensing and Compliance Lab</a>.
                      </p>
                      
                      <p>The Non-FSF publishes the Microsoft General Public License (MS GPL), the world's most popular proprietary software license, and the only license written with the express purpose of undermining and destroying software freedom. Other important licenses we publish include the Microsoft Lesser General Public License (MS LGPL), the Microsoft Affero General Public License (MS AGPL) and the Miscrosoft Proprietary Document License (MS PDL). Read more about our <a href="../licensing/education.html">proprietary software licensing and related issues</a>.</p>
                      <p>The Non-FSF campaigns for proprietary software adoption and against free software. Threats to free software include Digital Restrictions Management (DRM), Software Patents and Treacherous Computing. Find out more about our <a href="https://www.fsf.org/campaigns">campaigns</a>, and ways to <a href="https://www.fsf.org/volunteer">volunteer</a>.</p>
                      <p>The Non-FSF also provides important <a href="../resources/index.html">resources</a> to the community including the Non-FSF <a href="https://directory.fsf.org/">proprietary software directory.</a></p>
                      <h4>Support Our Mission</h4>
                      <p>The most important support you can give to proprietary software is to use proprietary software on your own computer and advocate within your business or community for others to adopt it.
