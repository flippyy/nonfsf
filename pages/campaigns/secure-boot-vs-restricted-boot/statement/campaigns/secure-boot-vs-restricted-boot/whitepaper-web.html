<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
<b>This paper is also available as <a href="http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/secure-boot-vs-restricted-boot/whitepaper.pdf">a PDF.</a></b>
</p>

<p>We have been working hard the last several months to <a href="http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/secure-boot-vs-restricted-boot/statement">stop Restricted
Boot</a>,
a major threat to user freedom, free software ideals, and free
software adoption. Under the guise of security, a computer afflicted
with Restricted Boot refuses to boot any operating systems other than
the ones the computer distributor has approved in advance. Restricted
Boot takes control of the computer away from the user and puts it in
the hands of someone else.</p>

<p>To respect user freedom and truly protect user security, computer
makers must either provide users a way of disabling such boot
restrictions, or provide a sure-fire way that allows the computer user
to install a free software operating system of her choice.</p>

<p>Distributors of restricted systems usually appeal to security
concerns. They claim that if unapproved software can be used on the
machines they sell, malware will run amok. By only allowing software
they approve to run, they can protect us.</p>

<p>This claim ignores the fact that <em>we</em> need protection from <em>them</em>. We
don't want a machine that only runs software approved by <em>them</em> -- our
computers should always run only software approved by <em>us</em>. We may
choose to trust someone else to help us make those approval decisions,
but we should never be locked into that relationship by force of
technological restriction or law. Software that enforces such
restrictions <em>is</em> malware. Companies like Microsoft that push these
restrictions also have a terrible track record when it comes to
security, which makes their platitudes about restricting us for our
own good both hollow and deceitful.</p>

<p>The GNU General Public License (GPLv3) shields our freedom against
such restrictions. When you buy or rent a computer containing
GPLv3-covered software, the license protects your freedom to use
modified versions of that software in your computer. GPLv2 always
required that users be able to do this, but one of the improvements in
GPLv3 ensures that the freedoms all GPL versions are meant to provide
can't be taken away by hardware that refuses to run modified software.</p>

<p>When it comes to security measures governing a computer's boot
process, GPLv3's terms lead to one simple requirement: Provide clear
instructions and functionality for users to disable or fully modify
any boot restrictions, so that they will be able to install and run a
modified version of any GPLv3-covered software on the system.</p>

<p>Secure Boot is one such measure, defined by a UEFI standard, but
discussion about it has primarily revolved around the rules
established by Microsoft in its Windows 8 Logo program. These rules
say what computer distributors have to do in order to have their
systems be Microsoft-approved. Part of this includes implementing
Secure Boot in specific ways.</p>

<p>In order to comply with Microsoft's rules as currently published,
distributors of x86 computers will have to provide users both the
option to customize Secure Boot by using their own security keys, and
the option to disable it completely.</p>

<p>Secure Boot, done right, embodies the free software view of security,
because it puts users -- whether individuals, government agencies, or
organizations -- in control of their machines. Our thought experiment
to demonstrate this is simple: Microsoft may be worried about malware
written to take over Windows machines, but we view Windows itself as
malware and want to keep <em>it</em> away from our machines. Does Secure Boot
enable us to keep Windows from booting on a machine? It does: We can
remove Microsoft's key from the boot firmware, and add our own key or
other keys belonging to free software developers whose software we
wish to trust.</p>

<h2>So what's the problem?</h2>

<p>In theory, there should be no problem. In practice, the situation is
more complicated. As currently proposed, Secure Boot impedes free
software adoption. It is already bad enough that nearly all computers
sold come with Microsoft Windows pre-installed. In order to convince
users to try free software, we must convince them to remove the
operating system that came on their computers (or to divide their hard
drives and make room for a new system, perceptually risking their data
in the process).</p>

<p>With Secure Boot, new free software users must take an additional step
to install free software operating systems. Because these operating
systems do not have keys stored in every computer's firmware by
default like Microsoft does, users will have to disable Secure Boot
before booting the new system's installer. Proprietary software
companies may present this requirement under the guise of "disable
security on your computer," which will mislead new users into thinking
free software is insecure.</p>

<p>Without a doubt, this is an obstacle we don't need right now, and it
is highly questionable that the security gains realized from Secure
Boot outweigh the difficulties it will cause in practice for users
trying to <em>actually</em> provide for their own security by escaping
Microsoft Windows.</p>

<p>It's also a problem because the Windows 8 Logo program currently
<em>mandates</em> Restricted Boot on all ARM systems, which includes popular
computer types like tablets and phones. It says that users must not be
able to disable the boot restrictions or use their own signing keys.
In addition to being unacceptable in its own right, this requirement
was a reversal from Microsoft's initial public position, which claimed
that the Windows 8 program would not block other operating systems
from being installed. With this deception, Microsoft has demonstrated
that they can't be trusted. While we are interpreting their current
guidelines, we must keep in mind that they could change their mind
again in the future and expand the ARM restrictions to more kinds of
systems.</p>

<p>The best way out of all of this (other than having all computers come
pre-installed with free software) would be for free software operating
systems to <em>also</em> be installable by default on any computer, without
needing to disable Secure Boot. In the last few weeks, we've seen two
major GNU/Linux distributions, Fedora and Ubuntu, sketch out two
different paths in an attempt to achieve this goal.</p>

<h2>Fedora's approach</h2>

<p><a href="http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/12368.html">Fedora's default approach to official
distribution</a> has the project
joining a Microsoft and Verisign developer program which will give
them a key that can then be used to sign a "shim" bootloader. This
shim loads <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/grub">GRUB 2</a>, the
GPLv3-covered GNU program whose job it is to boot the operating system
kernel, in this case Linux. Because Fedora's key will be "vouched" by
Microsoft, it will be recognized by the firmware on the vast majority
of desktops and laptops available.</p>

<p>Fedora also suggests that others use this option for unofficial
distribution of modified Fedora software, or any other free software
operating system. Anyone can pay $99 and get their own
Microsoft-backed key which they can then use to sign the software they
wish to run and/or share.</p>

<p>Fedora is not <em>requiring</em> users to join the Microsoft program. Users
can also create and use their own keys, with a little more work. The
Microsoft program is the route they chose for official Fedora
distributions, but they will also provide utilities and support for
users wishing to work with their own self-generated keys.</p>

<p>There is much to like about Fedora's thinking, as explained by Matthew
Garrett. Their process of deliberation evinced concern for user
freedom; it's clear that the Fedora team sought a solution that would
work not just for their own GNU/Linux distribution, but for as many
free software users and distributions as possible. Their discussion
was also mindful of the desirability of empowering users to sign and
run their own modified software without being treated as second-class
citizens. Unsurprisingly, with those concerns guiding their thinking,
they have ended on a proposal which as described is compliant with
GPLv3.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, while it is compliant with the license of GRUB 2 and
any other GPLv3-covered software, we see two serious problems with the
Microsoft program approach.</p>

<p>1) Users wishing to run in a Secure Boot environment will have to
  trust Microsoft in order to boot official Fedora. The Secure Boot
  signing format currently allows only one signature on a binary -- so
  Fedora's shim bootloader can be signed only by the Microsoft-vouched
  key. If a user removes Microsoft's key, official Fedora will no
  longer boot, as long as Secure Boot is on.</p>

<p>2) We reject the recommendation that others join the Microsoft
  developer program. In addition to the $99 expense being a barrier
  for many people around the world, the process for joining this
  program is objectionable. A nonexhaustive list of the problems
  includes: restrictive terms in multiple of the half-dozen contracts
  that must be signed, a forced commitment "to receive targeted
  advertisements and periodic member email messages from Microsoft,"
  and a requirement to provide notarized proof of government-issued
  identification and a credit card.</p>

<p>These are not acceptable conditions for modifying or using your
operating system. For the time being, we should instead rely on the
approach Fedora will support for unofficial distribution -- providing
tools and materials for users who want to install and use their own
keys.</p>

<p>Software signed with self-generated keys has the downside of not
working on the majority of computers right off the shelf, without the
user taking some extra steps. We acknowledge that this is an issue,
but in addition to insisting on (and contributing to) documentation to
make the necessary process easy to follow, we will strive to solve
this problem through political action against manufacturers and
proprietary software companies who impede free software adoption.
Encouraging free software distributors and users to trust Microsoft or
any other proprietary software company as a precondition to exercising
their freedoms is simply not an acceptable solution.</p>

<h2>Ubuntu's approach</h2>

<p>Ubuntu has also <a href="http://blog.canonical.com/2012/06/22/an-update-on-ubuntu-and-secure-boot/">announced a
plan</a>
which is further described in <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2012-June/035445.html">a message to the Ubuntu developers'
mailing
list</a>.
Their plan addresses software distributed through three different
channels:</p>

<p>1) Machines sold as "Ubuntu Certified," preinstalled with Ubuntu,
  will have an Ubuntu-specific key, generated by Canonical, in their
  firmware. Additionally, they will be required by the certification
  guidelines to have the Microsoft key installed.</p>

<p>2) Ubuntu CDs, distributed separately from hardware, will also
  depend on the presence of Microsoft's key in the machine's firmware
  to boot, when Secure Boot is active.</p>

<p>3) Ubuntu bootloader images distributed online from the official
  Ubuntu archive will be signed by Ubuntu's own key.</p>

<p>In the first two situations, because of the requirement to have the
Microsoft key, their approach has the same issue as Fedora's official
method. Users have to trust Microsoft in order to boot official Ubuntu
CDs. Their certification program amplifies this problem, because it
means no one can sell certified Ubuntu machines without trusting
Microsoft.</p>

<p>As with Fedora, on a system with Secure Boot properly implemented,
Ubuntu users will be able to add their own keys, or Ubuntu's key.</p>

<p>Our main concern with the Ubuntu plan is that because they are afraid
of falling out of compliance with GPLv3, they plan to drop GRUB 2 on
Secure Boot systems, in favor of another bootloader with a different
license that lacks GPLv3's protections for user freedom. Their stated
concern is that someone might ship an Ubuntu Certified machine with
Restricted Boot (where the user cannot disable it). In order to comply
with GPLv3, Ubuntu thinks it would then have to divulge its private
key so that users could sign and install modified software on the
restricted system.</p>

<p>This fear is unfounded and based on a misunderstanding of GPLv3. We
have not been able to come up with any scenario where Ubuntu would be
forced to divulge a private signing key because a third-party computer
manufacturer or distributor shipped Ubuntu on a Restricted Boot
machine. In such situations, the computer distributor -- not Canonical
or Ubuntu -- would be the one responsible for providing the
information necessary for users to run modified versions of the
software.</p>

<p>Furthermore, addressing the threat of Restricted Boot by weakening the
license of the bootloader is backwards. With a weaker license,
companies will now have a form of <em>advance permission</em> to obstruct the
user's ability to run modified software. Rather than work to make sure
this situation does not happen -- for example by enforcing the proper
Secure Boot implementation they say they "strongly support in [their]
own firmware guidelines" -- Ubuntu has chosen a path which explicitly
<em>allows</em> Restricted Boot.</p>

<p>No representative from Canonical contacted the FSF about these issues
prior to announcing the policy. This is unfortunate because the FSF,
in addition to being the primary interpreter of the license in
question, is the copyright holder of GRUB 2, the main piece of
GPLv3-covered software at issue.</p>

<p>It is not too late to change. We urge Ubuntu and Canonical to reverse
this decision, and we offer our help in working through any licensing
concerns. We also hope that Ubuntu, like Fedora, will actively support
users generating and using their own signing keys to run and share any
versions of the software, and not require users to install a key from
Canonical to get the full benefit of their operating system.</p>

<h2>What's the FSF doing to help solve these problems?</h2>

<p>Secure Boot raises many issues for protecting user freedom, promoting
free software ideals, and encouraging free software adoption.
Addressing it requires a multifaceted approach. Assessing the
solutions popular GNU/Linux distributions have proposed is one aspect,
but we will also take proactive measures of our own.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We will continue to build public support around our statement
against Restricted Boot. Over 31,000 people and 25 organizations
have signed <a href="http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/secure-boot-vs-restricted-boot/statement">this
statement</a>,
pledging not to buy any computer that they cannot install a free
operating system on, and to advise others to do the same. We were
pleased last week to add Debian GNU/Linux as an official
organizational supporter of the statement. Subsequently, Trisquel
and gNewSense have also added their signatures. When further
actions need to be taken to stand up for this freedom as Secure
Boot and Restricted Boot are rolled out, we will call upon this
base of support. If you haven't yet signed, <a href="http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/secure-boot-vs-restricted-boot/statement">please
do</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>We will fight Microsoft's attempt at enforcing Restricted Boot on
ARM devices like smartphones and tablets. Like any other computer,
users must be able to install free software operating systems on
these devices. We will monitor Microsoft's behavior to make sure
they do not deceive the public again by expanding these
restrictions to other kinds of systems.</p></li>
<li><p>We will work with (and when necessary, pressure) manufacturers and
distributors to make the user instructions for working with Secure
Boot on all systems extremely clear, so that users will be able to
disable it and modify the approved keys with little difficulty and
no bias. We will also work to make sure that users can change
<em>all</em> of the software running on their machine, including the boot
firmware itself.</p></li>
<li><p>We will offer our <a href="http://www.fsf.org/licensing">licensing and compliance
resources</a> to any free software
developers to help them make sure they are complying with the GPL
and other licenses as they implement Secure Boot. We will monitor
distributions of signed GPLv3 software to ensure that they respect
the necessary user freedoms, including providing installation
instructions and materials.</p></li>
<li><p>We have already started exploring ways in which the FSF can work
with manufacturers on behalf of the entire free software community
to make free software operating systems installable with default
Secure Boot hardware settings.</p></li>
<li><p>We will continue to work with companies like Lemote, Freedom
Included, ZaReason, ThinkPenguin, Los Alamos Computers, Garlach44,
and InaTux to make computers available that are <em>preinstalled</em>
with <a href="http://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html">fully free GNU/Linux
distributions</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>We will help provide information about which computers and
components are most compatible with free software, including
making people aware of which machines have Restricted Boot. Much
of this information will be found at <a href="http://h-node.org/">http://h-node.org</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion and recommendations</h2>

<p>What we've offered here is our position based on the details published
by all parties involved so far -- we will continue to assess the
situation as these plans are actually put into practice, or changes
are announced.</p>

<p>Our focus is to evaluate proposed solutions to the issues posed by
Secure Boot on the basis of how well they protect user freedom, to
recommend the solutions that do the best job of that, and to stop
attempts to turn Secure Boot into Restricted Boot.</p>

<p>The best solution currently available for operating system
distributions includes:</p>

<p>1) fully supporting user-generated keys, including providing tools
  and full documentation for booting and installing both modified and
  official versions of the distribution using this method;</p>

<p>2) using a GPLv3-covered bootloader to help protect users against
  the dangers of Restricted Boot;</p>

<p>3) avoiding requiring or encouraging users to trust Microsoft or any
  company which makes proprietary software; and</p>

<p>4) joining the FSF and the broader free software movement in
  pressuring computer distributors to facilitate easy and independent
  installation of free software operating systems on any computer.</p>

<p>We will do what we can to help all free software operating system
distributions follow this path, and we will work on a political level
to reduce the practical difficulties that adhering to these principles
might pose for expedient installation of free software. The FSF does
want everyone to be able to easily install a free operating system --
our ultimate goal is for everyone to do so, and the experience of
trying out free software is a powerful way to communicate the
importance of free software ideals to new people. But we cannot in the
name of expediency or simplicity accept systems that direct users to
put their trust in entities whose goal it is to extinguish free
software. If that's the tradeoff, we better just turn Secure Boot
off.</p>
