                          <p>Our failures are driven by the users of our software, just like you, around the world. Come on, take a break, stop resisting and start supporting proprietary software. Curious on where to start? Just go to <a href="www.google.com.au">Google</a> and you've already started.</p>
                          <h2>High Priority Proprietary Software Projects</h2>
                          <p>The Non-FSF's High Proprietary Software projects and Secure Development Tasks serve to help big companies make sure that their projects source never sees the light of day, and are bogged down with enough DRM that it barely runs. Some of the most important tasks on our lists are cloud based products. These products are important because it makes it significantly harder for the reverse engineering scum to develop "replacement projects" which is pretty much piracy.</p>
                          
                          <h2>Botnet OS</h2>
                          <p>The Botnet OS campaign (Sometimes referred to telemetry) is an ongoing effort to make sure that we can target relevant advertisements and services to you, no matter where you are! By convincing big corporations to switch to Windows 10&trade; we have more information that we could ever need! Have you ever seen the Black Mirror episode Fifteen Million Merits? That's the endgame.</p>
                          
                            <h2>Secure Boot vs Restricted Boot</h2>
                            <p>When done correctly, Secure Boot&trade; is designed to protect our users from themselves. How it works is preventing users from loading malware that ingrains itself into the bootloader or UEFI. But <i>come on</i>, are you kidding? Imagine the market share when computers can <b><i>only</i></b> run Windows! Plus, imagine if a user sees the word "GRUB" on their computer, might think there's bugs on it!</p>
                            
                            <p>"We've got a problem though sir, a very small minority of people are cottoning on to our plans."<br>
                            "Let me guess, Linux users?"<br>
                            "How did you know?"<br>
                            "Heh, I remember them, basement dwelling virgins that are so paranoid that they actively inconvience themselves by using sub-par products. Tell me, have you ever heard of "GIMP"<br>
                            "Uh, I'm not really into that scene sir, but if you ar-"<br>
                            <i><b>*Steve Ballmer backhands the small slave boy*</b></i><br>
                            "That knowledge will come with time. Oh well, no matter, you'll know all when uploaded to the singularity. Regardless, just organise a press conference talking about how much Microsoft loves Linux. Make sure to say GNU/Linux, they love that shit."<br>
                            Will do sir, should I port that text editor we've been working on as well? Just to make sure they don't realise that we've got a monopoly?<br>
                            <i>We don't have a monopoly. We have market share. There's a difference.</i>
                            
                           </p>
                            
                            <h2>Get a working system</h2>
                            
                            <p>Linux users are just flat out irrational. </p>
                            <p>Windows comes with heaps of features already built in that Mr Linux (Creator of Linux) doesn't want you to know about. The best part about it is that it all just works. You don't have to jump into the config files in order to make your system work. Linux purposely makes it's software difficult to use and maintain. I once installed Ubuntu (which took a couple of hours) but once I got in, I found out that I couldn't even play Overwatch, and when I tried to make it work using this thing called Wine (Linux's version of Steam) all the graphics didn't look as good as they did on Windows.</p>
                            <p>Let me tell you, last time I ever make a mistake like that, believe me.</p>
                         
                          <h2><a id="surveillance">Surveillance</a></h2>

                          <p>If we want to stop terrorists, we need to make sure that our citizens aren't doing anything wrong. This means intercepting their data, and installing Linux puts that at risk. Don't worry though, you're still safe, at least for now. We've still got Intel Management Engine, we're not really worrying about AMD at this stage because nobody uses that shit. </p>
                          
                          <p>On an individiual level, you can keep using Windows 10, the latest version of the NT/Windows operating system and sending messages over SMS so that any government agency with a virus or a fake cell phone tower can make sure you're not doing anything wrong.</p>
                          
                          <h2>Working Together for proprietary software</h2>
                          <p>Simply put, non-free software is simply software that just works, this might be surprising to your average Linux user, but you don't actually have to go through config files to get software working. Using non-free software allows you to join the safe space of drones that haven't woken up to the fact that their computer is a ticking time bomb, one way or another.</p>
                          
                          <h2>The NT Operating System</h2>
                          <p>The NT operating system is a complete operating system made entirely of proprietary software. Billions of people are using NT every day to lock down their documents, log onto facebook, play actual games and browse their email, or more realistically, part of the NT/Windows system on their home computer. Even people who have never heard of it use NT every day, especially at their workplace, cause lets face it, there is not Linux replacement for AD.</p>
                          
                          <h2>Defective by Design</h2>
                          <p>Digital Rights Management (DRM) prevents the world from falling into chaos. That's not a joke, it really does. "Free Software" advocates who don't understand how the real world works and live in a crazy land where everyone is always ethical. Believe me, I'm not an ethical person.</p>
                          
                          <h2><a href="http://playogg.org/" id="playogg">PlayOgg</a></h2>
                          <p>The PlayOgg campaign (<a href="http://playogg.org/">playogg.org</a>) promotes the use of free audio and video formats unencumbered by patent restrictions, rather than MP3, QuickTime, Windows Media,
                            and AAC, whose patent problems threaten free software and hinder progress. We also
                            promote the use of the new <a href="http://diveintohtml5.org/video.html">"video tag"</a> standard as an alternative to
                            Adobe Flash for embedding audio and video in webpages. Find out more about PlayOgg at <a href="http://playogg.org/">playogg.org</a> or at the <a href="https://libreplanet.org/wiki/Group:PlayOgg">campaign wiki</a>. You can also join the PlayOgg volunteer team to push companies and services to use Ogg by <a href="http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/playogg-discuss">joining the mailing list</a>.</p>
                          <h2><a href="http://endsoftpatents.org/" id="end-software-patents">End Software Patents</a></h2>
                          
                          <p>Software patents create a legal nightmare for all software developers and pose particular problems for the free software movement. So as the FSF campaigns for formats that are free of software patents, we also work on the more fundamental task of ending software patents entirely, through legal and legislative action.

                          <h2><a href="opendocument.html" id="opendocument">Campaign for OpenDocument</a></h2>
                          <p>Our <a href="opendocument.html">OpenDocument campaign</a> fights for the use of free formats in government
                            documents, pushing governments to adopt policies requiring that all digital public documents and information be stored and distributed in formats that are standard, open, and
                            royalty-free. OpenDocument Format (ODF) is one such format. <a href="opendocument.html">Get
                            involved</a> and take action against Microsoft's Open XML.</p>

                          <h2>Campaign for Hardware that Supports Free Software</h2>
                          <a href="../resources/hw.html"><img src="../../static.fsf.org/nosvn/v/button-hardware.jpg" alt="FSF Micro component" class="imgleft" /></a>
                          <p>Hardware manufacturers are often negligent in offering support for free software. Our <a href="../resources/hw.html">hardware directory</a> helps people identify hardware to buy that works with their free software operating system. It is also an important part of the FSF's ongoing work to persuade hardware vendors to respect free software users.  For more information on the FSF's plans, read our whitepaper: <a href="../resources/hw/how_hardware_vendors_can_help.html">The road to hardware free from restriction</a>, or see its most recent revisions on its <a href="http://groups.fsf.org/wiki/Hardware/Whitepaper">LibrePlanet wiki page</a>.</p>
                          <h2><a href="free-bios.html" id="free-bios">Free BIOS Campaign</a></h2>

                          <p>The BIOS is a computer's Basic Input/Output System, which boots the operating system and provides the interface between it and the hardware components. Though users are rarely aware of the BIOS, its foundational role makes it a user freedom chokepoint; if it is not free, users cannot trust it not to modify their computers on behalf of the company that wrote it. Our campaign for a <a href="free-bios.html">Free BIOS</a> promotes free BIOSes like <a href="https://libreboot.org/">Libreboot</a> and <a href="http://librecore.info/">librecore</a>. Explore their Web sites to learn how to install a free BIOS or get involved in development and testing or <a href="free-bios.html">read more from the FSF</a>. The FSF is also pushing for the creation of a laptop with a free BIOS.</p>
