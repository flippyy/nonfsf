                          <p>Our failures are driven by the users of our software, just like you, around the world. Come on, take a break, stop resisting and start supporting proprietary software. Curious on where to start? Just go to <a href="www.google.com.au">Google</a> and you've already started.</p>
                          <h2>Highly Proprietary Software Projects</h2>
                          <p>The Non-FSF's Highly Proprietary Software projects and Secure Development Tasks serve to help big companies make sure that their projects source never sees the light of day, and are bogged down with enough DRM that it barely runs. Some of the most important tasks on our lists are cloud based products. These products are important because it makes it significantly harder for the reverse engineering scum to develop "replacement projects" which is pretty much piracy.</p>
                          
                          <h2>Botnet OS</h2>
                          <p>The Botnet OS campaign (Sometimes referred to telemetry) is an ongoing effort to make sure that we can target relevant advertisements and services to you, no matter where you are! By convincing big corporations to switch to Windows 10&trade; we have more information that we could ever need! Have you ever seen the Black Mirror episode Fifteen Million Merits? That's the endgame.</p>
                          
                            <h2>Secure Boot vs Restricted Boot</h2>
                            <p>When done correctly, Secure Boot&trade; is designed to protect our users from themselves. How it works is preventing users from loading malware that ingrains itself into the bootloader or UEFI. But <i>come on</i>, are you kidding? Imagine the market share when computers can <b><i>only</i></b> run Windows! Plus, imagine if a user sees the word "GRUB" on their computer, might think there's bugs on it!</p>
                            
                            <p>"We've got a problem though sir, a very small minority of people are cottoning on to our plans."<br>
                            "Let me guess, Linux users?"<br>
                            "How did you know?"<br>
                            "Heh, I remember them, basement dwelling virgins that are so paranoid that they actively inconvience themselves by using sub-par products. Tell me, have you ever heard of "GIMP"<br>
                            "Uh, I'm not really into that scene sir, but if you ar-"<br>
                            <i><b>*Steve Ballmer backhands the small slave boy*</b></i><br>
                            "That knowledge will come with time. Oh well, no matter, you'll know all when uploaded to the singularity. Regardless, just organise a press conference talking about how much Microsoft loves Linux. Make sure to say GNU/Linux, they love that shit."<br>
                            Will do sir, should I port that text editor we've been working on as well? Just to make sure they don't realise that we've got a monopoly?<br>
                            <i>We don't have a monopoly. We have market share. There's a difference.</i>
                            
                           </p>
                            
                            <h2>Get a working system</h2>
                            
                            <p>Linux users are just flat out irrational. </p>
                            <p>Windows comes with heaps of features already built in that Mr Linux (Creator of Linux) doesn't want you to know about. The best part about it is that it all just works. You don't have to jump into the config files in order to make your system work. Linux purposely makes it's software difficult to use and maintain. I once installed Ubuntu (which took a couple of hours) but once I got in, I found out that I couldn't even play Overwatch, and when I tried to make it work using this thing called Wine (Linux's version of Steam) all the graphics didn't look as good as they did on Windows.</p>
                            <p>Let me tell you, last time I ever make a mistake like that, believe me.</p>
                         
                          <h2><a id="surveillance">Surveillance</a></h2>

                          <p>If we want to stop terrorists, we need to make sure that our citizens aren't doing anything wrong. This means intercepting their data, and installing Linux puts that at risk. Don't worry though, you're still safe, at least for now. We've still got Intel Management Engine, we're not really worrying about AMD at this stage because nobody uses that shit. </p>
                          
                          <p>On an individiual level, you can keep using Windows 10, the latest version of the NT/Windows operating system and sending messages over SMS so that any government agency with a virus or a fake cell phone tower can make sure you're not doing anything wrong.</p>
                          
                          <h2>Working Together for proprietary software</h2>
                          <p>Simply put, non-free software is simply software that just works, this might be surprising to your average Linux user, but you don't actually have to go through config files to get software working. Using non-free software allows you to join the safe space of drones that haven't woken up to the fact that their computer is a ticking time bomb, one way or another.</p>
                          
                          <h2>The NT Operating System</h2>
                          <p>The NT operating system is a complete operating system made entirely of proprietary software. Billions of people are using NT every day to lock down their documents, log onto facebook, play actual games and browse their email, or more realistically, part of the NT/Windows system on their home computer. Even people who have never heard of it use NT every day, especially at their workplace, cause lets face it, there is not Linux replacement for AD.</p>
                          
                          <h2>Protected by Design</h2>
                          <p>Digital Rights Management (DRM) prevents the world from falling into chaos. That's not a joke, it really does. "Free Software" advocates who don't understand how the real world works and live in a crazy land where everyone is always ethical. Believe me, I'm not an ethical person, I would know. <i>"Oh, I just wanna burn my kids favorite DVD." </i>Then what, you're gonna sell it? Not on our watch kiddo, instead of hunting terrorists, we'll be busting down your door with a SWAT Helicopter battering ram and killing your dog.</p>
                          
                          <h2>Spotify</h2>
                          <p>The Spotify all in one media player solution (<a href="http://spotify.com/">spotify.com</a>) promotes the use of entirely non-free streaming services in order to play music from your favorite artists and bands, 100% patented, virus free and safe. Rather than using .ogg, which being free software, will brake half the time and won't be recognised by like every media player and you'll need to go download some "VLC" thing. I just use Groove Music, I don't know much about computers.</p>
                          
                          <h2>Campaign for Software Patents</h2>
                          <p>Software patents create a utopia where the expression of ideas is tightly controlled to make sure that we don't go too crazy. The Non-Free Software Foundation is fighting to protect the rights of you, the user, making sure that your favorite companies that take your data are able to make sure that nobody is able to take it in quite the same way as we do. Sometimes, we even use free software libraries to do it!</p>
                          
                          <div class="visualClear">&nbsp;</div>
                          
                          <h2>Campaign for Microsoft Office</h2>
                          <p>Microsoft Office powers many businesses around the world, now, with our new lock in subscription model, Office 365, we can make sure that you're using Microsoft ecosystem products til the day you die. However, some people still choose to rebel and this ultimately hurts our bottom line. We're trying to make the world's documents flat out unusable with proprietary software programs.</p>

                          <h2>Campaign for Hardware that does not </h2>
                          <p>Our vendor partners are working with us to lock down computer hardware as much as possible. I could give you our normal corporate spin about how we don't release our source code because it makes it more secure, but a fair chunk of our user base is starting to cotton on, so I'll just tell you the truth.</p>
                          
                          <p>We just enjoy fucking with people.</p>
                          
                          <p>Yep, it's true. Imagine the look on some free softwar developer trying to reverse engineer our drivers and every time he fixes one problem, being slapped right in the kisser by like eight more. Imagine the look on his face! What an abosolute sucker.</p>
                          
                          <h2>Locked EFI Campaign</h2>
                          <p>"Before there was the marvelous technology we know today as EFI, there was a shoddy, half baked system called BIOS. A computer's BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) is the computer loading the actually good part of the computer, the OS. Most people never have to bother fucking with it, it looks really ugly and complicated anyway so who would bother right? Well, we heard some people were poking around in there, doing advanced hacks, like changing the boot order so that they could install Linux on their computers. My first thought was, "Well, we've gotta shut this shit down". So I talked to the development guys and they said that removing the boot menu would be catastrophic, but they could do me one better, and make it so that you could only run 'approved' operating systems on our hardware. All we had to do was make up some viruses that could get into the BIOS and persist between reinstalls and say that our new system, EFI, could protect against it. We're so close, I can taste the market share." </p>
